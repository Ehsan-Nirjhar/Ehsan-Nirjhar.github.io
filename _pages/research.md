My research interests are affective computing, signal processing, and machine learning.
I work on building computational frameworks to understand people's stress/anxiety in different settings using the multimodal bio-behavioral signals obtained from wearbale sensors.
Currently, I work in the following projects

* In-the-Moment Interventions for Public Speaking Anxiety
* Bio-Behavioral Data Analytics to Enable Personalized Training of Veterans for the Future Workforce
* Crowd-Biosensing Of Physical And Emotional Distress For Walkable Built Environment
