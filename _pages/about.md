I am a Ph.D. candidate and final year doctoral student at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University. 
Currently, I work in [HUman Bio-Behavioral Signals (HUBBS)](https://hubbs.engr.tamu.edu/) Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Theodora Chaspari. 
In broader sense, my research interests are affective computing, signal processing, and machine learning. 
My works focus on building computational frameworks to understand people's stress/anxiety in different settings using the multimodal bio-behavioral signals obtained from wearable sensors. 


Prior to joining TAMU, I completed my undergraduate studies in 2015 from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
I grew up and lived in Dhaka, the bustling capital city of Bangladesh, before moving to College Station, Texas, USA in 2017.

You can call me Ehsan. [Here's](https://www.pronouncenames.com/Ehsan) a good example to illustrate how to say it, as sometimes people find it difficult to pronounce. 
My countryfolks call me by my last name, Nirjhar, which actually is my nick name, not surname in conventional manner. (funny story!)

Thank you for visiting my webpage!
